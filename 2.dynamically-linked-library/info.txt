Dynamically linked libraries – here a program is linked with the shared library and the kernel loads the library (in case it’s not in memory) upon execution.

Man Pages:
    gcc - GNU C compiler
    ld - The GNU Linker
    ldd - List library dependencies
    ldconfig - configure dynamic linker run time bindings (update cache /etc/ld.so.cache)
		ldconfig creates the necessary links  and  cache	 to  the  most	recent
		shared  libraries  found	 in  the  directories specified on the command
		line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories, /lib
		and  /usr/lib  (on  some	 64-bit	 architectures such as x86-64, lib and
		/usr/lib are the trusted directories for 32-bit libraries, while /lib64
		and /usr/lib64 are used for 64-bit libraries).
